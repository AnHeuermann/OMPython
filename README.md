# OMPython

OMPython is a Python interface that uses CORBA (omniORB) to communicate with OpenModelica.

## Installation

- Python 2.7 is required. Download python from http://www.python.org/download/.

- omniORB is required to be installed including Python support (the omniidl command needs to be on the PATH)

- Add python to your PATH.

- Start command prompt/terminal and execute command "python setup.py install". This will add OMPython to the python 3rd party libraries.

- Now OMPython can be used as a library within any Python code:

  - import OMPython

  - help(OMPython)
